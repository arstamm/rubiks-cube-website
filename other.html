<th>PUZZLE</th>
<th>DISTCIPTION</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>4 BY 4 CUBE<p /><img src="images/4by4.jpg"></td>
<td>The 4 by 4 cube is a lot like the 3 by 3.  Unlike the 3 by 3, the centers are able to move around and swich with each other.  This charactoristic and many more makes this cube harder to solve than the 3 by 3.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>5 BY 5 CUBE<p /><img src="images/5by5.jpg"></td>
<td>Since the 5 by 5 has an odd number of rows, the centers do not move.  But the 5 by 5 is still challenging to solve.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>6 BY 6 CUBE<p /><img src="images/6by6.jpg"></td>
<td>The 6 by 6 is one of the most challenging puzzles I've ever solved.  Like the 4 by four, the centers move and like the 5 by 5, its challenging.  In a way, the 6 by 6 is like the 4 by 4 and 5 by 5 combined.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MEGAMINX<p /><img src="images/megaminx.jpg"></td>
<td>Because of the Megaminx's unique shape, instead of six sides, it has twelve.  Solving this puzzle is a lot like solving the 3 by 3 only with more steps added onto it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PYRAMINX<p /><img src="images/pyraminx.jpg"></td>
<td>While this pyramid shaped puzzle may look hard, the Pyraminx is accually one of the easiest puzzles to solve that I know of.  This puzzle can be extremely simple compared to other puzzles</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>REX CUBE<p /><img src="images/REXcube.jpg"></td>
<td>While this puzzle is shaped like a cube, the REX Cube is completly different from a 3 by 3.  Unlike the 3 by 3, this cube's peices turn at the corners instead of the sides.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SUPER SQUARE ONE<p /><img src="images/super_square_one.jpg"></td>
<td>The Super Square One is one of the most unique puzzles I know of.  When its solved,it's in the shape of a cube.  When it's scrambled on the other hand, it takes many interesting shapes.  I have never solved this puzzle before.</td>
